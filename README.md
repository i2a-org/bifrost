## What is IsItAlzheimers.org?

IsItAlzheimers.org (I2A) is where caregivers and at risk people will go to see if they may have a treatable dementia or really have Alzheimer's Disease. We will have an augmented intelligence system (code has been in development for 3 years) powering the backend. Tools include a polypharmacy engine, anticholinergenic engine, essential nutrient engine and others. There will also be a community forum.

## What is Bifrost?

To be able to evaluate patient data, IsItAlzheimers.org is required to collect anonymous health data. To do so, we have created an extendable open source API. Bifrost is designed to guide patients through the process of completing all the information that is required for up-to-date health reports. The system then processes the information and allows the frontend to display results to the patient.

All of the services that are provided through Bifrost are based on publicly available research papers. Bifrost is an implementation to bring all this research together in one simple and useful hub. We believe that by making this information public, we can assist patients and caretakers who are overwhelmed by the challenges of dementia.
